## Receipts Management System
A little info about your project and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is about.

## Motivation
As a team we were inspired by the idea behind the hackathon - fighting climate change with technologies. By looking through all the organizations that took part of the hakacthon, we decided to tackle the challenge of "Waste". We choose the organization "Buy Food With Plastic" mostly because of their ideals and goals. We were inspired by their message - recycling plastic bottles and providing food for many families in some of the most poorest countries in the worlds.
