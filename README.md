## Motivation
As a team we were inspired by the idea behind the hackathon - fighting climate change with technologies. By looking through all the organizations that took part of the hakacthon, we decided to tackle the challenge of "Waste". We choose the organization "Buy Food With Plastic" mostly because of their ideals and goals. We were inspired by their message - recycling plastic bottles and providing food for many families in some of the poorest countries in the world.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Power Virtal Agents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-virtual-agents/)
- [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)

## What makes the project stand out?
Our solution stands out for a few reasons. Firstly, people with no technical background can work with the system. This will save a lot of time and resources not only to the people involved with the organization, but to the organization itself. Secondly, we took into consideration that there might be more innovative and complex solutions to this problem. However, for us it is important to provide an easy fix to a complex thing. For that matter, the technologies we decided to proceed with are simple, but efficient and they do not need continues support or extra resources. Last but not least, the idea could be extented a lot by people with little or a lot of experience in the technical field. We wanted to make sure that more people will be able to build on top of this in the future.
